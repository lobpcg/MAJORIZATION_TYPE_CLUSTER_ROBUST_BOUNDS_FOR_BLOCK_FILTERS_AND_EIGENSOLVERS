Numerical examples for the paper "Majorization-type cluster robust bounds for block filters and eigensolvers"

https://github.com/lobpcg/.../example1.m illustrates several bound curves for the block Chebyshev and Lanczos methods; see Subsection 5.1. The novel majorization bounds (4.4) and (4.5) with tuplewise convergence factors are more accurate than the bounds (4.6) and (4.7) with scalar convergence factors.

https://github.com/lobpcg/.../example2.m is a further numerical comparison where the relevant eigenvalues are clustered; see Subsection 5.2. 

https://github.com/lobpcg/.../majle.m is a tool for checking majorization relations; also available in https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26962-majorization-check .

https://github.com/lobpcg/.../subspacea.m is a tool for computing principal angles; also available in https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/55-subspacea-m .

https://github.com/lobpcg/.../thm3_5.m checks the validity of Theorem 3.5 concerning the abstract block iteration (1.2). The contained bound deals with normal matrices and is more general than (4.4).

https://github.com/lobpcg/.../thm3_8.m is a similar validity check for Theorem 3.8 with a more general form of (4.5).
